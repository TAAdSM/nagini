For the purpose of maintaining a stable desired output, PID (proportional, integral, derivative) controllers are typically used.\r\n\r\n##Problem Statement\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yukunlin/nagini/master/pid.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nBalancing an inverted pendulum is a classic control problem. The embedded clip above  Our goal is to design a recurrent neural network that is able perform as well as (or better) than a PID controller at balancing the inverted pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
