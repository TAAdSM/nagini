##Evolving a Inverted Pendulum Controller with a Genetic Algorithm

See [here](http://yukunlin.github.io/nagini/) for more details.

###Running the demo
A working set of weights and biases are provided in `weights_working.txt` and
`biases_working.txt`. This is used by the provided mathematica notebook
(evaluate all cells after opening it).

###Running the genetic algorithm
Python 2.7 and numpy is required. Run
```
python trainer.py
```
to start the training. The training parameters are at the top of `trainer.py`.
